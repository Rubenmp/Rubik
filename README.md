# Rubik's cube
## History
Rubik's Cube is a 3-D combination puzzle invented in 1974 by Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture [Ern≈ë Rubik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ern%C5%91_Rubik). Originally called the Magic Cube.

In a classic Rubik's Cube, each of the six faces is covered by nine stickers, each of one of six solid colours: white, red, blue, orange, green, and yellow. In currently sold models, white is opposite yellow, blue is opposite green, and orange is opposite red, and the red, white and blue are arranged in that order in a clockwise arrangement.

## Introduction
The rubik's cube will be read from file or keyboard.
The standard position for the rubik's cube is: green side in front of you and white side up.
If your rubik's cube has different patterns or colours, look at this:

-Example 1: If the center of the left side is red, in all stickers you should select orange.

-Example 2: If the center of the back side is black, in your black stickers you should select blue.

The program will read 54 colours, one side each time.

## Colours
You can use three different options (simultaneously is possible not recommended):
   W/w/1 for white
   O/o/2 for orange
   G/g/3 for green
   R/r/4 for red
   L/l/5 for blue
   Y/y/6 for yellow

You will be able to change the colours. The program will show:
